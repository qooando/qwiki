# qwiki

Current status: **NOT WORKING**

QWiki is a free time personal project for fun.
It should be a simple client-server wiki application for non linear writing.
Furhtermore I use this project to learn Typescript and Node.js.

The main idea behind this project is to provide to our LARP authors group a free non linear writing tool built for non linear writing
and visualization.

Features I want to implement are:
- documents crud
- import and export of a lot of formats (
- frontend
- live inclusion and transclusion

It is still under heavy development, there is no stable version.

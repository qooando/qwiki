# qwiki

QWiki is a personal project aiming to write a simple wiki application from scratch in order to learn Typescript and Node.js
The main idea behind this project is to provide to our LARP authors group a free non linear writing tool built for non linear writing
and visualization.

Features I want to implement are:
- documents crud
- live inclusion and transclusion
- import and export of a lot of formats
- frontend
